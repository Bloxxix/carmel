# Meet Chris

#### A 40-year old dad with a low-tech job and a sore back.

What keeps Chris up at night is the thought that soon, he might lose his job to a machine and not be able to provide a future for his family in an increasingly technical world. There are many low-tech human workers like Chris out there, holding down jobs that are at risk with the rise of intelligent machines. 

**Perhaps you're one of them**.
