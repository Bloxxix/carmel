## It's (a)live!

I can't believe I'm writing this announcement but here we are. After 4 years of trial and error and after 13 months of heads down product development, we're absolutely thrilled to introduce you to **Carmel 1.0 - The Official Public Release**.

## Credits First

There's so many *out-of-this-world* people that need to be recognized for this release and I am not even going to say another word until I acknowledge these amazing human beings who have sacrificed endless days and nights to make this happen.

First off, my brothers from other mothers, the other 3 Carmel co-founders, who have poured their heart and soul into this product: **Andrei Lazurca**, **Robert Pop** and - what's the other guy's name ... Andi something. **Andi Coman**. I think that's it. You know we love you Andi. That's what you get when you're *aclowwwn*. You guys are ridiculously amazing and I'm proud you decided to embark on this journey with a non-millennial. I know, it's not your fault for having the attention of a - well, of a millennial. Note to self: don't be evil to millennials. They are people too. Guys, you're amazing. Lots of love.

I'm not going to embarrass my wife, Julia, by mentioning her on this. I'm not gonna mention how incredibly blessed I am to have the support of this amazing woman who believed in Carmel more than I did at times. When you create, when you pour your entire heart and soul into something - something big - there are those dark times when you doubt yourself, you doubt the vision, you doubt everything. I could've never seen the light of this day - when Carmel is finally out, alive and kicking - without the constant support of my wife - who I won't even mention in this post. I love you. But I'm not gonna mention that either.

I won't mention Andrei's wife, Claudia, either. I don't want to embarrass her by mentioning how blessed Andrei is and all of us for having her support through this arduous and literally impossible journey we've started together. You've got my entire admiration and love, Claudia. And Andrei, we're just getting started, brother. We're just getting started.

**Vlad** who is the biggest Carmel believer I've ever seen. You have been there from the beginning bro and your constant support meant so much every single time. **Chris** who mentored our interns like a champ. Our other **Chris** who is the **original intern** and the **inspiration** for the main hero of the Carmel Story. **Vincent** we still owe you breakfast, man! Thanks for making things happen early on and for putting your reputation on the line for Carmel. The other interns, **Joseph**, **Adrien**, and **Emanuel**. You guys are amazing. Our contributors, **Mariana**, **Mihai** & **Emanuel** and **Mihai T.**. Thanks for all your effort in getting the Carmel Story to this historical milestone.

I'm looking at you **Fuzzy** - thanks man for your constant help and wisdom. I've been to Fuzzy U in the past year. You're a blockchain encyclopedia man and I'm honored you shared so much with me on this journey. **Bluejays** - you were there from the beginning man and this story pretty much began with that interview a year ago. Thanks for believing in Carmel from the get-go, brother. I'm happy you're part of this journey. All our advisors - **NSJames** - dude, thanks for those initial talks that set me on the right path. Having you on board was always a huge boost for us man, even before EOS was a thing. **Paul** thank you for being part of the team and thanks for supporting us from the beginning, brother. **Emil** - thanks man. Just thanks. You're just awesome. **Roxana** thanks for joining us and for being such an incredible voice for Carmel. **Vivek**, my UofT bro, those nights coding in that computer lab 20 years ago are paying off eh? Thanks for believing in Carmel from day 1 dude. **Paul**, thanks for joining our team man and I'm looking forward to your continued wisdom as we grow from here. **Rennie**, my friend, so glad you decided to join this party. **Gheorghe** I am excited about seeing you get your hands dirty and building a real brain for Chunky.

## Introducing Tweak-N-Learn™

Yay, we're live. But that means what exactly. Right? Let's put it this way.

I believe what we have right now is the world's most exciting way of learning to create technology. Pure and simple. With Carmel, we've created a new **Tech Education** model that is nothing like anything out there at the moment. It's not face-to-face, in-classroom type education. And it's not video based online learning either.

We call it **Tweak-N-Learn™** and it's friggin awesome. We codified (the irony) how professionals developers write software and we packaged it up for the entire world to experience. It's very, very hard. It's a painful problem to solve. The reason why implementing Tweak-N-Learn™ is **very hard** is because the learner has to work within a real-world environment that also abstracts the nitty gritty of the Software Development Life Cycle. This is extremely difficult to accomplish. At best, one of two solutions are generally attempted.

The first is an environment where the Learner drags-and-drops widgets onto a page and the environment spits out a real product. This is what happens in most DIY website or app builders and the effect is that the product is indeed launched but the Learner has not acquired any real technical skills. So it is productive, but *not educational*.

The second approach is clearly seen in traditional programming courses where the learner acquires significant knowledge about the technology but not nearly enough hands-on practice. The result is that at the end of the course, video or in-person, the learner is ill equipped to produce real-world value. So it is educational, but *not productive*.

The Carmel Tweak-N-Learn™ model is unique in the sense that it is both educational and productive. With every completed Carmel Challenge, Chris not only acquires new technical skills but at the exact same time, he also produces real value by creating new real world features. Carmel literally bridges the gap between education and productivity.

And that, is **simply groundbreaking**.

## Hello Chunky

I thought I'd never get write to this section. If you love the promise of a new Tech Educational model, then you're gonna love this. We actually implemented it. You can actually try it out. Right now. Actually, hold on, finish this article first. So check this out. In order to implement Tweak-N-Learn™, we needed to implement an almost magical sublayer of the Carmel plaform that handles the Product Development side of things. Remember, our Tweak-N-Learn™ Tech Education model bridges the gap between **learning** (education) and **development** (productivity). So we needed to not only solve the first but the second problem too.

![hey chunky](https://github.com/fluidtrends/carmel/raw/master/assets/chunky-logo.gif)

And boy did we solve it. We actually created an entire Product Development Platform called **Chunky** (the perpetually happy Code Monkey) that handles all the grunt work so that you - the developer - will never get stuck doing monkey work. You know, the type of work that makes you wanna pull your eyes out with an invisible surreal and non-existent sharp object. Chunky does that for you. Not the eye poking thing. The grunt work. It's only fitting that a Code Monkey does the code monkey work. While you, the priviledged Carmel developer that you are, get to work on awesome higher-purpose creative development work. Pretty sweet deal if you ask me.

I won't even being to describe how awesome Chunky is here. I'll leave that for a separate dopamine infusing series of Tutorials on how Chunky will save your life as a developer. And make you coffee one day if we build him a real brain. One day. Wait, did that scare you? I take it back. No coffee. Just awesome development help that you will make you cry sweet tears of joy with every new line of code you write.

Once you create a Carmel Account (more details on how to get your prestigious key to the Carmel universe down below) - you will be guided to setup your development machine in what will end with you eventually installing Chunky and getting ready to get down to business.

Here's what the setup process looks like.

### Steps 1 to 4

The first 4 steps are pretty straight forward. We're guiding you to download the 4 most important tools in your arsenal as a Carmel developer. If you already have some of those tools installed, just skip that step and move on.

### Step 5

Here comes the interesting part. We're going to get Chunky installed on your machine, at this point.

![setup 5](http://files.carmel.io/media/setup-5.png)

And here's what it will actually look like when you open up your terminal and type that command in:

![chunky install](http://files.carmel.io/media/chunky-install.gif)

**Boom.** You should now have Chunky installed on your machine and ready for action. To test, you can just type **chunky** and see if it's there. Like this:

![chunky](http://files.carmel.io/media/chunky.gif)

### Step 6

Armed with Chunky, you can now login to your Carmel account straight from your terminal and say hello.

![setup 6](http://files.carmel.io/media/setup-6.png)

And here's what it should look like in action. It will ask you to login to your Carmel account first.

![hello](http://files.carmel.io/media/hello.gif)

*NOTE:*

*I get it, some of you might be terrified of the terminal and you can't stand typing commands at a command prompt. Fair enough. But if you want to become a Software Developer, you have to get your hands dirty my friend. Carmel is not miraculous magic pill that will automatically turn keystrokes into unicorns. Yet. Chin up. We'll improve the process as we go along. For now, get ready to flex them mental muscles and show your terminal some love.*

## Taking Your First Challenge

Ready? You can now take your first challenge from the Challenges list ([carmel.io/challenges](https://carmel.io/challenges)). Choose the **[Create a brand new product](https://carmel.io/challenges/create-your-first-product)** Challenge and as soon as you do that, you will be guided to your Carmel Workspace, with the challenge ready to proceed.

![start now](http://files.carmel.io/media/start-workspace.png)

Carmel then waits until you go back to your Terminal and type **chunky carmel next** to advance to the next point in the challenge. As soon as you do that, the first task is started. Carmel instructs you to complete the task and your Carmel Learning timer is started. This simply calculates the time it takes you to complete the task.

![start now1](http://files.carmel.io/media/start-workspace2.png)

The *MyProduct* folder name can be anything. Even *hello*, or whatever you want. Here's what it would look like in practice.

![start3](http://files.carmel.io/media/new-dir.gif)

As the task instructs you, you can now go into that folder and tell Chunky to create the product for you:

![start4](http://files.carmel.io/media/init.gif)

How cool is that? This is a real React project. As soon as you type **chunky carmel next** you can move on to the next task.

![start5](http://files.carmel.io/media/start-workspace3.png)

Next you want to tell Chunky to install all the product's dependencies. This will take a couple of minutes or more, depending on how fast your computer is and how fast your internet connection is.

![start6](http://files.carmel.io/media/install.gif)

And type **chunky carmel next** to go to the last task.

![start7](http://files.carmel.io/media/start-workspace4.png)

So now simply tell chunky to show you your newly created website. It's as simple as typing a command.

![start8](http://files.carmel.io/media/start-web.gif)

That's it! You just completed your first Carmel Challenge and you created your first React product from scratch. What you see in your newly opened browser tab there, is your website in action. That's a real website, with real code running, waiting for you to Tweak-N-Learn™ and continue your developer journey.

## Get Your CARMEL Tokens

We're excited to let you know that the [Carmel Token](https://eospark.com/token/carmel/carmeltokens) is live on the EOS Mainnet under the **carmeltokens** EOS Smart Contract. The first 100 token holders have received their CARMEL already and more will come soon. If you have participated in the previous two token distribution periods and you want your CARMEL, you have to enter your EOS username in your Carmel Profile at [carmel.io/me](https://carmel.io/me) and you will get your CARMEL in a new drop. There will be one a week until everyone gets their tokens.

We're currently in the 3rd Token Distribution Period (ending March 7th) and that means you have 3 weeks left to participate. To participate, send EOS to the **carmeltokens** EOS smart contract and you will get CARMEL back automatically. The price for this period is **1 CARMEL = 0.005 EOS**. So if you want more CARMEL, now's your chance to get some and hold on to them before we list.

Listing will begin as of April and we're really excited about us having a functional economy with an amazing community that truly believes in the Carmel Mission.

## Become a Carmel Community Leader

Join the Carmel Community Leaders group and help us spread the word about the Carmel Story. We've been at this for a good year now and we've been asked by a lot of you why we're not making more noise.

Our answer was simple and constant. We wanted to have something to talk about before we start talking.

And so, now that Carmel 1.0 is here to stay, we're ready to share so much goodness with the world. There's so much that can be done with Carmel already that it's going to be exciting creating content, articles, videos and even a podcast about the different things you can do with Carmel.

We've built a tool for builders. Carmel is a meta product. It helps builders build. Its applications are endless and absolutely insane. And I can't wait for us to share all that through content that we will be creating as of today.

But we need your help to share that content with the world.

We will gladly create bounties and award you with CARMEL tokens for your efforts but more than anything, you will gain Chunky's favor.

So you're in? If so, [check this out and fill this form to get started](https://goo.gl/forms/u9m4SyRiGgBnKFMC3) and Andrei will get back at you with the masterplan. If you're on Telegram, just join our [Carmel Community Leaders](https://t.me/carmelcommunityleaders) group too and we can continue this conversation there.
