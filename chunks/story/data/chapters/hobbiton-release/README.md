Thank God it's Monday!

And that means we've got ourselves a fresh batch of Product Updates. 

Today is a special Monday - it's Release Day. Woohoo!

We just wrote an amazing new chapter of the Carmel Story. Namely, the **Hobbiton Release** is complete. Boom! We've managed to release a lot of new functionality that we hope you will all enjoy.
