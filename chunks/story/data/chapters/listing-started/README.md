## Exchange Listing Has Officially Started

Hey Carmel family - guess what? We have exciting news for all of you all!

As of today, the CARMEL token is ready for trading on the first exchange. We're live on [DEXEOS.io](https://dexeos.io/trade/?market=eos&code=carmeltokens&symbol=CARMEL) and that is great news indeed.

But, before you go run off and dump all your CARMEL, hear me out.

You all know we've been working on Carmel for a while now and we took our sweet time listing the token. We made a tough decision from the beginning, namely to focus on building a valuable product first. **Product First**, token second. That's been our motto from the beginning and we stood by it. And here we are, always standing.

We all know how easy it is to chase the money trail, especially in the world of crypto. But that, my friends, is not - and never will be - the Carmel Way.

We made a conscious decision to make sure we build - not only the right thing - but in the right order too. And for the right reasons.

There's so much more work for us to do. In fact, Carmel will never stop. It will keep on going. It will keep on evolving. And it will keep on growing. We've gotten to a point where our core technology works well and while the journey is still far and wide open ahead of us, today is a new day.

Today we believe is the right time for us to take the Carmel Story to the next level.

We're excited to list CARMEL on [DEXEOS.io](https://dexeos.io/trade/?market=eos&code=carmeltokens&symbol=CARMEL) as of April 1st and give you all the opportunity to stack up on tokens.

Of course, you could also dump all your current CARMEL. And you would be within your right to do so.

What I am asking you though, is to consider Carmel as a long term investment. Imagine what we can all build here together. We are paving the way for a new world where tech skills are not the domain of a small elite of genius programmers. Carmel is breaking new ground like nothing before it.

Is this valuable? Will it be worth something?

You bet.

And where value abounds, the financial gains abound too. Eventually.

Let's build Carmel - together.

Here's the thing, it will take a village to build Carmel. It will take all of us.

The more we invest in Carmel, the more Carmel will pay us back. When the time is right.

Today, as we launch on the first exchange, the time to extract value from Carmel is not here yet.

* DO Hold on to your existing CARMEL tokens.
* DO Get more CARMEL tokens.
* And please consider NOT dumping your CARMEL.

The time will come for us all to profit financially - well - but until then, let's continue putting the **common good** of our community ahead of our own short term gain. We do that - and I promise you - the common good will return the favor when the time is right.

Share this with your friends and keep believing.

Carmel will change the world.

But only with your help.
