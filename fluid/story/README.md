**Redefining Human Work In The Machine Era**

*Carmel closes the Great Digital Divide through a new way of doing digital work that makes Digital Innovation accessible to all and empowers non-technical workers and small non-digital organizations to capitalize on the digital opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.*

The pace of Digital Transformation sweeping the 21st century is without precedent. We are
witnessing the nascent Fourth Industrial Revolution in all its accelerated glory. Web, mobile and
cloud technologies lead the charge and a suite of exponentially powerful innovations are rapidly
penetrating all aspects of our lives. Voice apps, chat bots, artificial intelligence, blockchain, 5G
connectivity, the internet of things and many more are spawning out of research labs and are
being commercialized and deployed across all industries with an ever increasing adoption rate.
In the midst of this Digital Age, tech-savvy workers and large digital enterprises are thriving,
flourishing and growing as they are equipped to harness the many and varied digital
opportunities available. Not only are jobs and business models transforming digitally, but our
very global economy itself is turning digital.
