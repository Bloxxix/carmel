## The Carmel Problem

>> **The Great Digital Divide**: the market exclusion of non-technical workers and small non-digital organizations.

**Non-technical workers and small non-digital organizations are being pushed out of
the market as they struggle to harness digital opportunities and are unable to keep
up with the pace of digital transformation.**

While some are set to thrive, the accelerated rate of change is widening an already painful
Digital Divide and lack of access to the same digital opportunities is leaving millions of workers
and organizations behind. While the digital opportunities abound and are globally available, in
practice the same opportunities are not equally accessible to all. And access to the new global
Digital Economy is key to successful personal and business development. Workers lagging
behind in tech skills and small businesses struggling to keep up with digital transformation are
particularly at risk. Both non-technical workers and small non-digital organizations struggle to
harness digital opportunities and are headed without fail towards market exclusion. The Great
Digital Divide of the 21st century is not only about people lacking access to the Internet
anymore but also about workers and organisations lacking access to the Digital Economy as a
whole. This is a hard problem dividing our society in two and weâ€™re passionately out to solve it.
